# workflow at Forfuture

This repository holds documentation on our workflow and development
process at [Forfuture, LLC](http://www.forfuture.co.ke).

**Why put this in the Public domain?** We continuously strive to
improve our quality of work. It's with this spirit that we
open-sourced our development process. With outside contributions
and discussions, we hope to improve it. Other progressive teams
may want to emulate our work flow.
